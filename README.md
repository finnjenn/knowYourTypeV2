# Know Your Type (Version 2)

Hello I am a new web developer and this is one of my first projects!

The goal of this application is to help Pokemon trainers become more familiar with Pokemon Type matchups.

Did you know there are currently 18 different pokemon types?

Most people know that Water is good against Fire types but that only covers a one-directional relationship between 2 types.

Open using index.html and click the get started button.

Choose the types you would like to use or (what I suggest) pick random to train a wide variety of matchups.
Next choose what type your opponent will be or (again, my suggestion) pick random.

If you're just starting, try out all of your moves and see how much damage you are doing to your opponent.
Use the 'Chart' button in the top right corner to activate a Bootstrap modal that shows you information about how types match up with each other.
These together will begin increasing your Pokemon knowledge and lead you to sure victory.

Click 'Next' to move on or 'Home' to return to the type selection page.
